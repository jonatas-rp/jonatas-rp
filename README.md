## 🧍 About me

I’m a Software Engineer with hands-on experience building scalable backend systems, APIs, and data pipelines across AWS and containerized environments. I specialize in Python and Go, leveraging frameworks like FastAPI, Django, and Gin to develop high-performance REST services.

My work often combines cloud-native infrastructure, IaC, and DevOps automation — using AWS CDK, CloudFormation, and GitHub Actions to deliver reliable CI/CD pipelines.

I’ve also architected event-driven systems using SQS, RabbitMQ, and Celery for asynchronous job processing. Built data pipelines that integrate for log analytics and monitoring. I have extensive experience in JWT validation, Oauth2, OIDC, SAML for building authentication and authorization systems.
