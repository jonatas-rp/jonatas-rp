## 🧍 About me

I design and build backend platforms that power distributed systems at scale.

My work centers on event-driven architectures, workflow orchestration, and asynchronous job execution frameworks on AWS. I’ve contributed to building internal orchestration platforms that replace managed workflow services, enabling flexible, composable infrastructure and distributed service execution.

I specialize in Python for high-performance backend systems, and I design cloud-native architectures using AWS CDK and CloudFormation. I focus on reliability, scalability, and creating reusable infrastructure abstractions that improve developer velocity.

Beyond service development, I build CI/CD automation, observability pipelines, and secure auth systems.
